## AWESOME GYM

Awesome Gym is a modern **multi-purpose** gym that caters for most of the fitness needs of young professionals working in Dublin .
There are 3 main areas that any member can enjoy on a 24 / 7 basis:

 - Fitness/Weights, with the most advanced machines available.
 - 50 metres Swimming pool.
 - 2 Climbing Walls (beginners and advanced)
 
 We also have our own cafeteria and dinning area on the ground floor.
 Parking available as well.

**UX**
-
This website has been designed with both owners and customers in mind.
Gym owners know that nowadays having a well designed website is key to attract and get new members.
On the other hand, gym members need and demand an **easy to use** online tool to make their payments, get information and quickly resolve any queries they may have.
